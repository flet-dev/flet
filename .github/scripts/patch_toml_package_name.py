# /// script

"""
This script patches the `[project].name` field in a
TOML file (typically `pyproject.toml`).

It is intended for cases where you want to change the package name
programmatically without touching any other fields or comments in the file.

The script:
    - Loads the specified TOML file using `tomlkit`.
    - Replaces the value of `project.name` with the new package name provided.
    - Writes the modified TOML back to the same file.

Usage:
    uv run patch_toml_package_name.py <toml_file> <new_package_name>

Arguments:
    toml_file         Path to the TOML file to patch (e.g., pyproject.toml).
    new_package_name  The new package name to set in `[project].name`.

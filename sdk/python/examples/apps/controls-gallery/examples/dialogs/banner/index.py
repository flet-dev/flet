description = """A banner displays an important, succinct message, and provides actions for users to address (or dismiss the banner). A user action is required for it to be dismissed.

Banners are displayed at the top of the screen, below a top app bar. They are persistent and non-modal, allowing the user to either ignore them or interact with them at any time."""

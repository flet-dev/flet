description = """A filled tonal button is an alternative middle ground between FilledButton and OutlinedButton buttons. Theyâ€™re useful in contexts where a lower-priority button requires slightly more emphasis than an outline would give, such as "Next" in an onboarding flow. Tonal buttons use the secondary color mapping."""

# Flet - quickly build interactive apps for Web, Desktop and Mobile in Python

[Flet](https://flet.dev) is a rich User Interface (UI) framework to quickly build interactive Web, Desktop and Mobile apps in Python without prior knowledge of web technologies like HTTP, HTML, CSS or JavaSscript. You build UI with [controls](https://flet.dev/docs/reference/controls) based on [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) to ensure your programs look cool and professional.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7 or above on Windows, Linux or macOS

## Installation

```
pip install flet
```

## Hello, world!

```python
import flet
from flet import Text

p = flet.page()
p.add(Text("Hello, world!"))
```

Run the sample above and a new browser window will pop up:

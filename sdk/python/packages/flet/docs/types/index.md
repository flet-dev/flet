# Types

Explore the shared building blocks that power Flet apps: aliases, base controls, reusable classes, enums, events, and exceptions.

- [Aliases](aliases.md) - shorthand names and conveniences for common patterns.
- [Base Controls](../controls/basecontrol.md) - foundational control types to extend and compose.
- [Classes](alignment.md) - core data structures (layout, animation, theming, platform info, and more).
- [Decorators](component.md) - helpers for defining components, controls, and observables.
- [Enums](animationcurve.md) - constant sets that define options for controls and services.
- [Events](accelerometerreadingevent.md) - callback payloads emitted by controls and services.
- [Exceptions](fletexception/index.md) - Flet-specific error types for diagnostics and handling.
- [Methods](createcontext.md) - utilities for lifecycle, hooks, and component state.

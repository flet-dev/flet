title: Publish app to a static website
---

Instructions for publishing Flet app into a standalone static website (SPA) that runs entirely in the browser with 
[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/index.html) and does not require any code running on the server side.

Pyodide is a port of CPython to WebAssembly (WASM) which is an emerging technology with [some limitations](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/wasm-constraints.html).

::note Native Python packages
Native Python packages (vs "pure" Python packages written in Python only) are packages that partially written in 
C, Rust or other languages producing native code. Example packages are `numpy`, `cryptography`, `lxml`, `pydantic`.

Pyodide comes with a big list of [built-in packages](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html). However, to use a Python package from PyPI it must be a 
pure Python package or provide a wheel with binaries [built for Emscripten](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/development/new-packages.html).

### Async and threading

Flet app that published to a static website could use both sync and async event handlers and methods.
Pyodide is a WebAssembly application which does not support threading. The entire Flet is running in a single thread 
and all sync and async control event handlers are running in the same thread. If your app has CPU-bound logic 
(e.g. calculating Fibonacci ðŸ˜€) or "sleeps" to make UI prettier it may "hang" UI. Consider moving that logic to 
a server and calling it via web API. Using `asyncio.sleep` in async methods is OK though.

Publish Flet app as a static website.

This is the recommended publishing method for static website.

### Prerequisites

Flutter SDK [must be installed](../../../publish/index.md#flutter-sdk) on your computer for `flet build web` command to work.

### Building website

To publish Flet app as a static website run the following command from the root of your Flet app:

```
flet build web
```

A static website is published into `./build/web` directory.

### Testing website

You can test a published Flet app using Python's built-in [`http.server` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html):

```
python -m http.server --directory build/web
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to check the published app.

### Packaging assets

Once the website is published all files from `assets` directory will be copied "as is" to the root of the website.

This allows overriding such things as `favicon.png` or ` manifest.json` with your own content.

### URL strategy

Flet apps support two ways of configuring URL-based routing:

* **path** (default) - paths are read and written without a hash. For example, `fletapp.dev/path/to/view`.
* **hash** - paths are read and written to the [hash fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator#Syntax). For example, `fletapp.dev/#/path/to/view`.

If a hosting provider supports [Single-page application (SPA) rendering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/serving-pages/#single-page-application-spa-rendering) you can leave default "path" URL strategy as it gives pretty URLs.

However, if a hosting provider (like GitHub Pages) doesn't support SPA mode then you need to publish your app with "hash" URL strategy.

Use `--route-url-strategy` argument to change URL strategy.

### Web renderer

You can change default "canvaskit" web renderer ([more about renderers here](../../../cookbook/fonts.md) to "html" with `--web-renderer` option:

```
flet build web --web-renderer html
```

### Color emojis

To reduce app size default "CanvasKit" renderer does not use colorful emojis, because the font file with color emojies weights around 8 MB.

You can, however, opt-in for color emojis with `--use-color-emoji` flag:

```
flet build web --use-color-emoji
```

Alternatively, switch to `html` renderer which uses browser fonts.

### Hosting website in a sub-directory

Multiple Flet apps can be hosted on a single domain - each app in it's own sub-directory.

To make a published Flet app work in a sub-directory you have to publish it with `--base-url` option:

```
flet build web --base-url <sub-directory>
```

For example, if app's URL is `https://mywebsite.com/myapp` then it must be published with `--base-url myapp`.

## Disable splash screen

The [splash screen](../../index.md#splash-screen) is enabled/shown by default.

It can be disabled as follows:

/// tab | `flet build`
```bash
flet build apk --no-android-splash
```
///
/// tab | `pyproject.toml`

/// tab | `[tool.flet]`
```toml
[tool.flet]
splash.android = false
```
///
/// tab | `[tool.flet.splash]`
```toml
[tool.flet.splash]
android = false
```
///

///

## <code class="doc-symbol doc-symbol-command"></code> `flet publish`

An alternative method to publish Flet app as a static website.

Compared to [`flet build web`](#flet-build-web) command it does not require Flutter SDK to be installed on your computer.

However, static websites built with `flet build web` command, compared to `flet publish`, have faster load time 
as all Python dependencies are now packaged into a single archive instead of being pulled in runtime with `micropip`. 
`flet build web` also detects native Python [packages built into Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html), such as `bcrypt`, `html5lib`, `numpy` 
and many others, and installs them from Pyodide package registry.

### Publish app as a static website

Run the following command to publish Flet app to a standalone website:

```
flet publish <your-flet-app.py>
```

A static website is published into `./dist` directory.

Command optional arguments:

* `--pre` - allow micropip to install pre-release Python packages.
* `-a ASSETS_DIR`, `--assets ASSETS_DIR` - path to an assets directory.
* `--app-name APP_NAME` - application namee.
* `--app-description APP_DESCRIPTION` - application description.
* `--base-url BASE_URL` - base URL for the app.
* `--web-renderer {canvaskit,html}` - web renderer to use.
* `--route-url-strategy {path,hash}` - URL routing strategy.

### Testing website

You can test a published Flet app using Python's built-in [`http.server` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html):

```
python -m http.server --directory dist
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to check the published app.

### Loading packages

You can load custom packages from PyPI during app start by listing them in `requirements.txt`. `requirements.txt` must be created in the same directory with `<your-flet-app.py>`.

Each line of `requirements.txt` contains a package name followed by an optional version specifier.

/// admonition | Micropip
    type: tip

To install custom packages Pyodide uses [micropip](https://pypi.org/project/micropip/) - a lightweight version of `pip` that works in a browser.

You can use [Micropip API](https://micropip.pyodide.org/en/stable/project/api.html) directly in your Flet app:

```python
import sys

if sys.platform == "emscripten": # check if run in Pyodide environment
    import micropip
    await micropip.install("regex")
```
///

#### Pre-release Python packages

You can allow loading pre-release versions of PyPI packages, by adding `--pre` option to `flet publish` command:

```
flet publish <your-flet-app.py> --pre
```

### Assets

If your app requires assets (images, fonts, etc.) you can copy them into website directory by using `--assets <directory>` option with `flet publish` command:

```
flet publish <your-flet-app.py> --assets assets
```

::caution
If you have `assets` directory in your app's directory and don't specify `--assets` option then the contents of `assets` will be packaged along with a Python application rather than copied to `dist`.
::

### URL strategy

Flet apps support two ways of configuring URL-based routing:

* **Path** (default) - paths are read and written without a hash. For example, `fletapp.dev/path/to/view`.
* **Hash** - paths are read and written to the [hash fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator#Syntax). For example, `fletapp.dev/#/path/to/view`.

If a hosting provider supports [Single-page application (SPA) rendering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/serving-pages/#single-page-application-spa-rendering) you can leave default "path" URL strategy as it gives pretty URLs.

However, if a hosting provider (like GitHub Pages) doesn't support SPA mode then you need to publish your app with "hash" URL strategy.

To specify "hash" URL strategy during static app publishing use `--route-url-strategy` option:

```
flet publish <your-flet-app.py> --route-url-strategy hash
```

### Web renderer

You can change default "canvaskit" web renderer ([more about renderers here][flet.WebRenderer]) to "html" with `--web-renderer` option:

```
flet publish <your-flet-app.py> --web-renderer html
```

### Color emojis

To reduce app size default "CanvasKit" renderer does not use colorful emojis, because the font file with color emojies weights around 8 MB.

You can, however, opt-in for color emojis with `--use-color-emoji` flag:

```
flet publish <your-flet-app.py> --use-color-emoji
```

Alternatively, switch to `html` renderer which uses browser fonts.

### Hosting website in a sub-directory

Multiple Flet apps can be hosted on a single domain - each app in it's own sub-directory.

To make a published Flet app work in a sub-directory you have to publish it with `--base-url` option:

```
flet publish <your-flet-app.py> --base-url <sub-directory>
```

For example, if app's URL is `https://mywebsite.com/myapp` then it must be published with `--base-url myapp`.

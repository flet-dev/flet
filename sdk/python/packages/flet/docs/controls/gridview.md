::: flet.GridView

::info
GridView is very effective for large lists (thousands of items). #
Prefer it over wrapping [`Column`][flet.Column] or [`Row`][flet.Row] for smooth scrolling. 
See [Flet Icons Browser](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/icons-browser/main.py) 
for GridView usage example.

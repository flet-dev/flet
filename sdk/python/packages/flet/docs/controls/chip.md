### Assist chips

Assist chips are chips with [`leading`][flet.Chip.leading] icon and [`on_click`][flet.Chip.on_click] event specified.

They represent smart or automated actions that appear dynamically and contextually in a UI.

An alternative to assist chips are [buttons](buttons/index.md), which should appear persistently and consistently.

### Filter chips

Filter chips are chips with [`on_select`][flet.Chip.on_select] event specified.

They use tags or descriptive words provided in the [`label`][flet.Chip.label] to filter content.
They can be a good alternative to switches or checkboxes.

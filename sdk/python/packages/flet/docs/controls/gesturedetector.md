### Handling events

```python
--8<-- "../../examples/controls/gesture_detector/handling_events.py"
```

### Draggable containers

The following example demonstrates how a control can be freely dragged inside a Stack.

The sample also shows that GestureDetector can have a child control (blue container) as well as be nested
inside another control (yellow container) giving the same results.

```python
--8<-- "../../examples/controls/gesture_detector/draggable_containers.py"
```

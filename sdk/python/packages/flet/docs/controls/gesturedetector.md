### Handling events

```python
--8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flet-dev/flet/refs/heads/docs/fix-links/sdk/python/examples/controls/gesture-detector/handling-events.py"
```

### Draggable containers

The following example demonstrates how a control can be freely dragged inside a Stack.

The sample also shows that GestureDetector can have a child control (blue container) as well as be nested
inside another control (yellow container) giving the same results.

```python
--8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flet-dev/flet/refs/heads/docs/fix-links/sdk/python/examples/controls/gesture-detector/draggable-containers.py"
```

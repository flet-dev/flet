Navigation and routing is an essential feature of Single Page Applications (SPA) which allows organizing application user interface into virtual pages (views) and "navigate" between them while application URL reflects the current state of the app.

For mobile apps navigation and routing serves as a [deep linking](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/navigation/deep-linking) to specific application parts.

Well, it took [more efforts](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/95/files) than expected to add navigation and routing into Flet as the implementation is based on [Navigator 2.0](https://medium.com/flutter/learning-flutters-new-navigation-and-routing-system-7c9068155ade) Flutter API and required to replace Flet's "Page" abstraction with "Page and Views". Flutter's newer navigation and routing API has substantial improvements such as:

1. Programmatic control over history stack.
2. An easy way to intercept a call to "Back" button in AppBar.
3. Robust synchronization with browser history.

## Page route

Page route is a portion of application URL after `#` symbol:

![Page address and route](../assets/navigation-routing/page-address-route.png)
/// caption
///

Default application route, if not set in application URL by the user, is `/`. 
All routes start with `/`, for example `/store`, `/authors/1/books/2`.

Application route can be obtained by reading `page.route` property, for example:

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    page.add(ft.Text(f"Initial route: {page.route}"))

ft.run(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

Grab application URL, open a new browser tab, paste the URL, modify its part after `#` to `/test` and hit enter. You should see "Initial route: /test".

Every time the route in the URL is changed (by editing the URL or navigating browser history with Back/Forward buttons) Flet calls `page.on_route_change` event handler:

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    page.add(ft.Text(f"Initial route: {page.route}"))

    def route_change(e: ft.RouteChangeEvent):
        page.add(ft.Text(f"New route: {e.route}"))

    page.on_route_change = route_change
    page.update()

ft.run(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

Now try updating URL hash a few times and then use Back/Forward buttons! You should see a new message added to a page each time the route changes:

<img src="/img/docs/navigation-routing/page-route-change-event.gif"className="screenshot-60" />

Route can be changed programmatically, by updating `page.route` property:

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    page.add(ft.Text(f"Initial route: {page.route}"))

    def route_change(e: ft.RouteChangeEvent):
        page.add(ft.Text(f"New route: {e.route}"))

    def go_store(e):
        page.route = "/store"
        page.update()

    page.on_route_change = route_change
    page.add(ft.ElevatedButton("Go to Store", on_click=go_store))

ft.run(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

Click "Go to Store" button and you'll see application URL is changed and a new item is pushed in a browser history. 
You can use browser "Back" button to navigate to a previous route.

## Page views

Flet's [`Page`][flet.Page] now is not just a single page, but a container for [`View`][flet.View] 
layered on top of each other like a sandwich:

<img src="/img/docs/navigation-routing/page-views.svg" className="screenshot-100" />

A collection of views represents navigator history. Page has [`page.views`][flet.Page.views] property to access views collection.

The last view in the list is the one currently displayed on a page. Views list must have at least one element (root view).

To simulate a transition between pages change `page.route` and add a new `View` in the end of `page.view` list.

Pop the last view from the collection and change route to a "previous" one in 
[`page.on_view_pop`][flet.Page.on_view_pop
] event handler to go back.

## Building views on route change

To build a reliable navigation there must be a single place in the program which builds a list of views 
depending on the current route. Other words, navigation history stack (represented by the list of views) 
must be a function of a route.

This place is [`page.on_route_change`][flet.Page.on_route_change] event handler.

Let's put everything together into a complete example which allows navigating between two pages:

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    page.title = "Routes Example"

    def route_change(route):
        page.views.clear()
        page.views.append(
            ft.View(
                "/",
                [
                    ft.AppBar(title=ft.Text("Flet app"), bgcolor=ft.Colors.SURFACE_CONTAINER_HIGHEST),
                    ft.ElevatedButton("Visit Store", on_click=lambda _: page.go("/store")),
                ],
            )
        )
        if page.route == "/store":
            page.views.append(
                ft.View(
                    "/store",
                    [
                        ft.AppBar(title=ft.Text("Store"), bgcolor=ft.Colors.SURFACE_CONTAINER_HIGHEST),
                        ft.ElevatedButton("Go Home", on_click=lambda _: page.go("/")),
                    ],
                )
            )
        page.update()

    def view_pop(view):
        page.views.pop()
        top_view = page.views[-1]
        page.go(top_view.route)

    page.on_route_change = route_change
    page.on_view_pop = view_pop
    page.go(page.route)


ft.run(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

Try navigating between pages using "Visit Store" and "Go Home" buttons, Back/Forward browser buttons, 
manually changing route in the URL - it works no matter what! :)

/// admonition
    type: note
To "navigate" between pages we used [`page.go()`][flet.Page.go] - a helper method that updates 
[`page.route`][flet.Page.route], calls [`page.on_route_change`][flet.Page.on_route_change] event handler to update views and finally calls `page.update()`.
///

Notice the usage of [`page.on_view_pop`][flet.Page.on_view_pop] event handler. It fires when the user 
clicks automatic "Back" button in [`AppBar`][flet.AppBar] control. In the handler we remove the last element 
from views collection and navigate to view's root "under" it.

## Route templates

Flet offers [`TemplateRoute`][flet.TemplateRoute] - an utility class based on [repath](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/python-repath) library which allows matching 
ExpressJS-like routes and parsing their parameters, for example `/account/:account_id/orders/:order_id`.

`TemplateRoute` plays great with route change event:

```python
troute = TemplateRoute(page.route)

if troute.match("/books/:id"):
    print("Book view ID:", troute.id)
elif troute.match("/account/:account_id/orders/:order_id"):
    print("Account:", troute.account_id, "Order:", troute.order_id)
else:
    print("Unknown route")
```

You can read more about template syntax supported by `repath` library [here](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/python-repath#parameters).

## URL strategy for web

Flet web apps support two ways of configuring URL-based routing:

- **Path** (default) - paths are read and written without a hash. For example, `fletapp.dev/path/to/view`.
- **Hash** - paths are read and written to the [hash fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator#Syntax). For example, `fletapp.dev/#/path/to/view`.

To change URL strategy use `route_url_strategy` parameter of `flet.app()` method, for example:

```python
ft.run(main, route_url_strategy="hash")
```

URL strategy for Flet Server can be configured with `FLET_ROUTE_URL_STRATEGY` environment variable which could be set to either `path` (default) or `hash`.

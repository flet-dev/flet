Flet supports two primary ways of defining colors:

1. Hexadecimal values
2. Named colors

## Hexadecimal Values

Hex color values follow either of these formats:

* `#aarrggbb` or `0xaarrggbb`
* `#rrggbb` or `0xrrggbb` (opacity defaults to `ff` if `aa` is omitted)

```python-repl
>>> ft.Container(bgcolor="#ff0000")
```

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/colors/controlcolors)

## Named Color

Flet uses Material Design [theme colors](https://m3.material.io/styles/color-the-color-system/color-roles)
and [color palettes](https://m2.material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-and-palettes).

You can define named colors in two ways:

* As a **string** (e.g., `"blue"`, `"redAccent100"`)
* Using the `Colors` or `CupertinoColors` **enums** for better type safety and autocompletion

```python-repl
>>> ft.Container(bgcolor="yellow")
>>> ft.Container(bgcolor=ft.Colors.YELLOW)
>>> ft.Container(bgcolor=ft.CupertinoColors.DESTRUCTIVE_RED)
```

### Theme Colors

[Live Example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/colors/themecolors)

There are 30 named theme colors in [`Theme.color_scheme`][flet.Theme.color_scheme] that are generated based on
the [`Theme.color_scheme_seed`][flet.Theme.color_scheme_seed], which defaults to [`Colors.BLUE`][flet.Colors.BLUE].

```python-repl
>>> page.theme = ft.Theme(color_scheme_seed=ft.Colors.GREEN)
```

Any of the 30 theme scheme colors can be overridden, in which case they will have an absolute value
that will no longer be dependent on the seed color.

```python
page.theme = ft.Theme(
    color_scheme=ft.ColorScheme(
        primary=ft.Colors.GREEN,
        error=ft.Colors.RED,
    ),
)
```

Theme colors serve as fallback values for most Flet controls.

### Color Palettes

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/colors/colorspalettes)

Originally introduced by Material Design in 2014, **color palettes** are collections of coordinated
colors designed to work together harmoniously.

Each **color swatch** (palette) includes multiple shades of a specific color, where lower numbers
represent lighter shades and higher numbers represent darker ones.
Most palettes range from `50` to `900`, in increments of `100`, while **accent swatches**
(e.g., [`Colors.RED_ACCENT`][flet.Colors.RED_ACCENT]) have only `100`, `200`, `400`, and `700`.

In addition to color swatches, Flet provides named black and white variants with built-in opacities, such as:
- [`Colors.BLACK54`][flet.Colors.BLACK54] → black at 54% opacity
- [`Colors.WHITE70`][flet.Colors.WHITE70] → white at 70% opacity

These palette colors can be used:
- directly as values for control color properties (e.g., `bgcolor`, `color`)
- as seed colors for generating dynamic theme color schemes using [`Theme.color_scheme_seed`][flet.Theme.color_scheme_seed]

### Color opacity

Flet provides multiple ways to set opacity:

#### Using `with_opacity`

This method is present in both [`Colors`][flet.Colors] and [`CupertinoColors`][flet.CupertinoColors] enums.
It takes a [color](#) and an opacity, and returns a string in the format `"color,opacity"`, understood by Flet.

```python-repl
>>> ft.Colors.with_opacity(0.5, ft.Colors.RED)
"red,0.5"
>>> ft.CupertinoColors.with_opacity(0.8, ft.CupertinoColors.LINK)
"link,0.8"
```

#### Embedding Opacity in Hex Code

For colors in hex format, you can specify the `aa` channel with values between `00` and `ff`.

```python-repl
>>> "#7fff6666"  # (1)!
```

1. Red color at 50% opacity (`7f`).

## Defining colors for Flet controls

Most Flet controls have default colors defined by the [`Theme.color_scheme`][flet.Theme.color_scheme],
and these can be overridden at various levels.

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/colors/controlcolors)

<img src="/img/docs/colors/colors_fallback.svg"className="screenshot-80" />

### Control Level

If a color is provided as value for a control's color-like property, it will be used directly.

```python
>>> ft.Card(bgcolor=ft.Colors.GREEN_200)
```

Note:
    Not every Flet control has a color property that can be set on the control level.
    For example, [`FilledButton`][flet.FilledButton] always has a default "primary" color
    that is defined by the nearest ancestor's `theme`.

### Control Theme Level

The [`Theme`][flet.Theme] object has a lot of properties that can be used to override default
colors for Flet controls.

For example, the nearest [`Theme.card_bgcolor`][flet.Theme.card_bgcolor] will be used for the
[`Card`][flet.Card] control.

Note:
    If you need to change theme for particular descendants, you can wrap
    them in a [`Container`][flet.Container], for example, and customize its
    [`theme`][flet.Container.theme] property, which will be applied to
    all its descendants.

### Ancestor Theme Level

Flet searches upward in the widget tree to find the nearest ancestor with a defined `theme`, and will take color
from its [`Theme.color_scheme`][flet.Theme.color_scheme]. In the example below, the nearest anscestor for the [`FilledButton`][flet.FilledButton]
is [`Container`][flet.Container], and the `primary` color that is used for the button will be taken from the
[`Container.theme`][flet.Container.theme].

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    page.add(
        ft.Container(
            width=200,
            height=200,
            border=ft.border.all(1, ft.Colors.BLACK),
            content=ft.FilledButton("Primary color"),
            theme=ft.Theme(color_scheme=ft.ColorScheme(primary=ft.Colors.YELLOW))
        )
    )

ft.run(main)
```

If no theme is defined for a control, its parent, or its parent’s ancestors, the control defaults to
using the uppermost ancestor's theme, which is [`Page.theme`][flet.Page.theme]
(or [`Page.dark_theme`][flet.Page.dark_theme] in dark mode).

## Example

```python

```

/// admonition | Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
    type: note
On WSL, you need to install [`GStreamer`](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer) library.

If you receive `error while loading shared libraries: libgstapp-1.0.so.0`,
it means `GStreamer` is not installed in your WSL environment.

To install it, run the following command:

```bash
apt install -y libgstreamer1.0-0 gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-tools
```

Today we announce the first release of Flet!

Flet is a framework for building real-time web, desktop and mobile applications in Python.

No more complex architecture with JavaScript frontend, REST API backend, database, cache, etc. With Flet you just write a monolith stateful app in Python only and get multi-user, realtime Single-Page Application (SPA) or a mobile app.

To start developing with Flet, you just need your favorite IDE or text editor. No SDKs, no thousands of dependencies, no complex tooling - Flet has built-in web server with assets hosting and desktop clients.

Flet UI is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), so your app looks professional and can be delivered to any platform. Flet simplifies Flutter model by combining smaller "widgets" into ready-to-use "controls" with imperative programming model.
You get all the power of Flutter without having to learn Dart!

Flet app is deployed as a regular web app and can be instanly accessed with a browser or installed as a [PWA](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) on a mobile device. Web app also exposes an API that can be used by a Flet client (planned for [future releases](/roadmap)) running on iOS and Android and providing native mobile experience.

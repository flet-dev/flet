    For example, if there is an [`Button`][flet.Button]
    inside [`Container`][flet.Container] with
    [`GestureDetector`][flet.GestureDetector] then tapping on
    a button won't be "visible" to a gesture detector behind it. With
    `TransparentPointer` a tapping event doesn't stop on a button, but goes up to the
    parent, similar to event bubbling in HTML/JS.

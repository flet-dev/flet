        type: tip

    - Use `base64` command (on Linux, macOS or WSL) to convert file to Base64 format:
        ```bash
        base64 -i <image.png> -o <image-base64.txt>
        ```

    - On Windows you can use PowerShell to encode string into Base64 format:
        ```posh
        [convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path "your_file_path" -Encoding byte))
        ```

    Represents an icon used in the UI.

    An icon can come from:

    - the Material icon set via the [`Icons`][flet.Icons] enum,
    - the Cupertino icon set via the [`CupertinoIcons`][flet.CupertinoIcons] enum,
    - or a custom icon set defined by the developer.

    Internally, an icon is stored as an integer that encodes icon's index
    in its originating code set.

    Encoding structure:

    - Lower 16 bits (bits 0-15): the icon's index.
    - Third byte (bits 16-24): the icon set identifier (set ID),
        which distinguishes between icon sets like Material, Cupertino, etc.

    This encoding scheme allows a single integer to uniquely represent any icon
    across multiple icon sets.

  * New `--ios` switch for `flet run` command to test Flet app on your iOS device.
  * [Testing on iOS guide](https://flet.dev/docs/guides/python/testing-on-ios).
  * [serious_python](https://pub.dev/packages/serious_python) Flutter package to add Python support to a Flutter app.
  * [An example of Flutter app](https://github.com/flet-dev/serious-python/tree/main/example/flet_example) combining [serious_python](https://pub.dev/packages/serious_python) package, [flet](https://pub.dev/packages/flet) package and your Python program into a ready iOS app.
* Part of `flet` package logic moved to a new `flet-runtime` package. `flet` package depends on `flet-runtime`. The new `flet-embed` package introduced depending on `flet-runtime` - to run Python apps embedded into Flutter apps.

```python
ft.app(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER, web_renderer=ft.WebRenderer.HTML)
```

* Flet packages `version` is centralized in `flet_core.version`.
* 💥 **Breaking change:** OAuth providers must be imported from `flet.auth.providers` module, for example:

```python
from flet.auth.providers import GitHubOAuthProvider
```

* New `BottomSheet` properties: `dismissible`, `enable_drag`, `show_drag_handle`, `use_safe_area` ([#1468](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/issues/1468)).
* `ListTile.toggle_inputs` property - clicking on a list tile should toggle the state of `Radio`, `Checkbox` or `Switch` inside the tile.
* New `page` methods for showing/closing overlays: `page.open_banner()`, `page.close_banner()`, `page.open_dialog()`, `page.close_dialog()`, `page.open_bottom_sheet()`, `page.close_bottom_sheet()`.
* New `FletApp` properties: `reconnect_interval_ms`, `reconnect_timeout_ms`, `on_error`.
